# ComponentOne MAUI Samples

Deliver beautiful desktop and mobile applications fast with advanced datagrids, calendars, and more for MAUI.

This repository contains the samples for [ComponentOne MAUI Edition](https://www.grapecity.com/componentone/maui-ui-controls). These samples provide complete implementation details for the MAUI control features. 

The samples reference, but do not include, the control packages. The control packages can be downloaded from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=C1.Maui) or [grapecity.com/componentone](grapecity.com/componentone).

## Building a Sample 

MAUI samples require Visual Studio 2022 and above. 

Then run these commands from the CLI in the directory of any sample: 

```
dotnet build 
dotnet run 
```

This will install any needed dependencies, build the project, and run the project respectively.
